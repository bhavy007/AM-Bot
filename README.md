# AM-Bot

AM-Bot can simulate interviews for Account Manager role.

## Installation

To get started with AM-Bot, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bhavy007/AM-Bot
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and use pip to install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Add API Key

You will need to add your API key to the `secrets.toml` file in the `.streamlit` directory. If you don't have an API key, obtain one from the relevant service provider.

```toml
[api_credentials]
api_key = "sk-..."
```

Replace `"sk-..."` with your actual API key.

For now I have provided my own GPT API key.
Please note: Keep your API key confidential and never share it publicly.

## Usage

Now that you have the project set up and your API key configured, you can run the project and start using it as intended.
